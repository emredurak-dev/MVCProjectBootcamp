## 💻✨MVC Bootcamp
I have completed the 100 Lessons MVC Bootcamp Project, which was offered for free on YouTube. In this project, inspired by the 'eksi sozluk' website, authors can write comments, send messages to other users, and create new topics. The administrator has full control over the system and can access all transactions from the panel.

## ✔Author Panel
🔸Profile: The author can update personal information.

🔸Articles: The author can display the titles created by herself/himself.

🔸Headings: All headings found on the site are listed.

🔸Messages: The author can send messages to other users, view incoming messages, and reply. Also, the author can create a Draft Message, format and re-transmit it.

## ✔Admin Panel
🗂️Category: The list contains the categories where titles are added to the site.

📋Heading: The titles available on the site are listed and their contents can be displayed.

💼Article: All entries on the site are listed and the search filter can be applied.

👥Author: Those who sign up on the site are listed, and new users can be added.

🖼️Gallery: Images on the site are listed.

💌Contact: The Admin can display incoming messages and create new messages, like the author panel.

🚫Authorization: New admins can be added and admin permissions can be updated.

📄Skill Card: Added a skills card that can be dynamically updated.
